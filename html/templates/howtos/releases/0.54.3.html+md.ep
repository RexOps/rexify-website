#### path_map - variable path mapping

path_map is a new feature developed by Erik Huelsmann to ease the management of files for different hosts. In the past, if you wanted to upload a file (for example /etc/security/access.conf) to your servers and wanted to have different access.conf files per environment, or for a special host, you had to build this logic by yourself. With the *path_map* feature you only have to define the lookup path and Rex is doing this for you.

<pre><code class="perl">use Rex -feature => ['0.54'];

set path_map => {
  "files/" => [
    "files/{environment}/{hostname}/",
    "files/{environment}/",
    "files/{hostname}/",
  ],
  "templates/" => [
    "templates/{environment}/{hostname}/",
    "templates/{environment}/",
    "templates/{hostname}/",
  ],
};

task "setup", group => "frontends", sub {
  file "/etc/security/access.conf",
    source => "files/etc/security/access.conf",
    owner  => "root",
    group  => "root",
    mode   => 644;

  file "/etc/ntp.conf",
    content => template("templates/etc/ntp.conf"),
    owner   => "root",
    group   => "root",
    mode    => 644;
};</code></pre>

This example will search for the files it should upload or process as templates in the following direction:

**Given:**

* environment = production
* hostname = fe01

**Lookup-Path:**

* files/production/fe01/etc/security/access.conf
* files/production/etc/security/access.conf
* files/fe01/etc/security/access.conf
* files/etc/security/access.conf

**And for the template it is just the same:**

* templates/production/fe01/etc/ntp.conf
* templates/production/etc/ntp.conf
* templates/fe01/etc/ntp.conf
* templates/etc/ntp.conf

You can use **any** variable that the inventory can [gather from the system](/howtos/book/getting_info_of_the_environment.html).
