# Release notes for 0.55.1
These are the changes in the 0.55.1 release.

This is mainly a bugfix release with a minor new feature.

## Rex::Test

### Specify which tests to run as a parameter for Test:run

Now you can use the `--test=` parameter to choose which tests you want to run with Test:run:

<pre><code class="bash">$ rex Test:run --test=t/mytest.t</code></pre>

Globbing also works:

<pre><code class="bash">$ rex Test:run --test=t/*_test</code></pre>

Default value is: `t/*.t`
