# JobControl

JobControl is a small webinterface to manage and execute Rex Tasks. Currently it is in early development stage and we are looking for feedback from the community to get known to their needs.

So if you have wishes, suggestions or bug reports don't hesitate to contact us via or [issue tracker](https://github.com/RexOps/rex-jobcontrol/issues) on Github or or irc channel on [irc.freenode.net/irc](irc://irc.freenode.net/rex).

## Getting Started

To get started with JobControl we suggest using CentOS/RHEL 7, Fedora, OpenSuSE or Ubuntu 12.04/14.04. Currently we don't have init scripts for System V init. But if you want to install JobControl on CentOS 6 or Debian this won't be much work to generate those.

Also you need a 64bit installation of your OS because one module JobControl uses needs support for 64bit integers in your perl interpreter.

### Architecture

JobControl consists of 2 services. One webfrontend, which is written in [Mojolicious](http://www.mojolicio.us/). And a worker (called *minion*). This worker is executing long running actions like imports of *Rexfiles* and execution of Jobs. It is possible to start multiple workers.

You can control JobControl via the webinterface or via the *rexify* command line tool that ships with Rex. Currently there is no REST API integrated but this is planed for a later version.


## Installation Guides

* [CentOS 7](/howtos/jobcontrol/installation_centos.html)
* [Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04](/howtos/jobcontrol/installation_ubuntu.html)

## Managing Users

* [Default user management](/howtos/jobcontrol/managing_users.html)

## Accessing the Webfrontend

After you have setup JobControl the *setup* command created a first user with username *admin* and password *admin*. The Webinterface is listening on the port 8080. To connect to it, you have to make sure that there is no firewall blocking this port.

So now you can point your browser to *http://$your-server:8080*.

## Creating Projects and Jobs

You can organize your *Rexfiles* by creating projects and jobs. Projects can contain multiple jobs. You need at least one project.

Jobs consists of one or more *Rexfiles*. In a job you can define in which order your *Rexfiles* and *tasks* should be executed and which fail strategy it should follow.

You can also create *Formulars*. With formulars you can create self service portals for your team or other teams. For example you can create a formular for your developers so that they can create new virtual machines with a pre installed and configured apache webserver on it without the need to ask you.
