<h1>Using (R)?ex to manage OpenWrt systems</h1>

<p><a href="https://openwrt.org">OpenWrt</a> is a Linux distribution for embedded devices and it is primarily aimed for and used on routers. This means that every component is optimized for size to fit into the limited resource constraints of these devices. As a result some things are working a bit differently than on a full-blown desktop or server distribution. This guide tries to help you getting started with using Rex to manage OpenWrt boxes.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>What's working?</h3>

<p>Please see the <a href="compatibility.html#embedded">official compatibility page</a>. You may also want to check the current project weather on <a href="https://build.rexify.org">build.rexify.org</a>.</p>

<h3>Known limitations</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service status</strong></p>

<p>Despite OpenWrt provides a <code>service_check()</code> function in <code>/lib/functions/service.sh</code>, it seems that it's only sporadically used in initscripts. Nevertheless Rex currently implements its service status check via this function but it's more of a workaround than a solution. It's also worth noting that sometimes the initscript's name and its executable's name are not the same (e.g cron vs. crond). You should use the executable's name in your OpenWrt status checks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Missing renice</strong></p>

<p>AFAIK renice isn't available for OpenWrt.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inventory gathering</strong></p>

<p>OpenWrt doesn't provide dmidecode for all architectures so this might or might not work for you.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>&gt;=rex-0.43: initial support has been added in this release</li>
<li>Attitude Adjustment (12.09 final): latest stable OpenWrt release as of 2014-01-12 and the only one which is tested to work with Rex, but Rex might work with other releases as well - let us know! :)</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally you'll need the following packages on your OpenWrt box on top of a vanilla install:</p>

<ul>
<li>SFTP server: openssh-sftp-server or gesftpserver</li>
<li>perl</li>
<li>perl modules: perlbase-bytes perlbase-data perlbase-digest perlbase-essential perlbase-file perlbase-xsloader</li>
</ul>

<p>Optional packages (only for specific Rex functions):</p>

<ul>
<li>sync_up: rsync</li>
<li>user management: shadow-groupadd shadow-groupdel shadow-groupmod shadow-useradd shadow-userdel shadow-usermod</li>
<li>inventory gathering: dmidecode</li>
</ul>

<h2>Details</h2>

<h3>SFTP server</h3>

<p>By default OpenWrt doesn't provide an SFTP server. As Rex does lots of lower level operations via SFTP (<code>is_dir()</code>, <code>is_file()</code>, ...), the first package you should install on your box is either openssh-sftp-server or gesftpserver.</p>

<p>A massively subjective comparison of these two may help to make your decision:</p>

<h4>openssh-sftp-server</h4>

<ul>
<li>easier to set up</li>
<li>a bit smaller size in itself</li>
<li>depends on libopenssl and zlib (and they are "huge" and probably not needed by other packages)</li>
<li>only supports SFTP v3 (that should be fine in general though)</li>
<li>widespread use</li>
<li>BSD licensed</li>
</ul>

<p>It can be set up with the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>opkg update
opkg install openssh-sftp-server
</code></pre>

<h4>gesftpserver</h4>

<ul>
<li>needs some (minimal) tinkering after installation</li>
<li>a bit bigger in size in itself</li>
<li>no cumbersome dependencies, good for minimal systems</li>
<li>supports SFTP v3-v6</li>
<li>still under development</li>
<li>GPL licensed</li>
</ul>

<p>It can be set up with the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>opkg update
opkg install gesftpserver
mkdir /usr/libexec
ln -s /usr/bin/gesftpserver /usr/libexec/sftp-server
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to automate the set up of the chosen SFTP server on a fresh OpenWrt installation, just put the according steps into <code>run</code> calls in a Rex task. The bottom line is to don't try to use the built-in <code>mkdir</code> and <code>symlink</code> functions at this point as they are broken before you have an SFTP server in place.</p>

<p>You can find out more about gesftpserver and a comparison of different SFTP implementations/versions on <a href="http://www.greenend.org.uk/rjk/sftpserver/">their website</a>.</p>

<h3>Perl</h3>

<p>You'll need to install the following packages:</p>

<ul>
<li>perl: obviously</li>
<li>perlbase-bytes, perlbase-essential: very basic set of perl modules</li>
<li>perlbase-data: for Data::Dumper</li>
<li>perlbase-file: for glob operations</li>
<li>perlbase-digest: perlbase-data dependency and it is nice to have in order to speed up file operations in general (via MD5 hashing)</li>
<li>perlbase-xsloader: perlbase-data and perlbase-file dependency</li>
</ul>

<h3>rsync</h3>

<p>Merely needed by sync_up functionality.</p>

<h3>shadow-*</h3>

<p>OpenWrt doesn't provide traditional user and group management commands by default as these procedures are rarely needed in the majority of the targeted use cases. However, if you really need to do these type of stuff on your router, you're in luck, as you can easily install these packages from the official repository:</p>

<ul>
<li>shadow-groupadd</li>
<li>shadow-groupdel</li>
<li>shadow-groupmod</li>
<li>shadow-useradd</li>
<li>shadow-userdel</li>
<li>shadow-usermod</li>
</ul>
