=head2 This is the code for rexify.org

Don't blame me for the code... I hate creating websites...

=head2 Run it locally

If you want to make changes and test these changes on your workstation follow these steps:

=over

=item *

Clone the repo: C<git clone https://github.com/RexOps/rexify-website.git>

=item *

Install Perl modules: C<cpanm --installdeps .>

=item *

Start a local webserver: C<cd html && hypnotoad website.pl>

=item *

Open L<http://localhost:8080> in your favorite browser

=back

=head2 Browse Rex API docs locally

This is most probably going to change, but we still felt like documenting the current method until then.

=over

=item *

Clone the Rex repo: C<git clone https://github.com/RexOps/Rex.git>

=item *

Generate the docs by running C<misc/create_pod.sh> (currently it only works with the C<pod2html> version coming with perl-5.14.4)

=item *

Symlink the C<doc/html/Rex> directory generated in the Rex repo as C<html/templates/api/Rex> under the rexify-website repo

=item *

Open L<http://localhost:8080/api/index.html> in your favorite browser
