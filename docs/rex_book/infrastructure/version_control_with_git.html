<p>We recommend you to use a version control system for your development. Especially if you're working in a team it will bring you many advantages. Also if you want to see the difference between two versions of the same file you can ask your vcs system.</p>
<p>A working vcs is also the base to work in teams. So every teammate can be sure that he/she has the latest available version of the files.<br />Advantages if you use a VCS</p>
<ul>
<li>You can revert changes</li>
<li>You have a history of changes</li>
<li>You can easily work together with teammates</li>
<li>You can experiment with new features using an own branch that doesn't affect production.</li>
</ul>

<pre>$ git push origin master</pre>
<h2>The workflow</h2>
<p>Now as you setup your repository you can use the following workflow to update your local repository and to upload your changes to GitHub.</p>
