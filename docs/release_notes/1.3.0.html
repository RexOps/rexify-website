<p>These are the changes in the 1.3.0 release.</p>

<p>We want to thank every contributor who made this release possible.
We also welcome Dmitry Kopytov as new contributor.</p>

<p>During this release cycle
we tried to focus more on smoothing out the rougher edges
and improving the documentation and test suite.
Several aspects of the documentation work
are mainly happening in the background
and not in the codebase itself for now.
So there are no "real" new features this time,
but because of the amount of changes,
and especially because of enabling the new template engine by default,
we felt a new major release was warranted.</p>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<h3>New template engine enabled by default</h3>

<p>The enhanced template engine, <code>template_ng</code>,
has been available since 0.56.0
via the similarly named feature flag.
The main advantage of it
is the ability to provide actually useful error messages
when something goes wrong during template processing,
while the format itself remains backward compatible
with the previous template handling.
There are some examples of those error messages on the <a href="https://github.com/RexOps/Rex/issues/465">original issue</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>added template_ng tests - Jan</li>
<li>fixed a problem when one template object was used twice - Jan</li>
<li>new template engine for 1.3 - Jan</li>
</ul>

<h3>Automatic parallelism settings</h3>

<p>It is now possible set parallelism of task execution more dynamically,
e.g. by setting it to <code>max</code>,
Rex detects the number of servers a task should be run on,
and automatically executes it on all of them in parallel.
Some other notation are recognized and supported as well,
like <code>max/3</code>, or <code>max 10%</code>.
For details,
check out the <a href="http://www.rexify.org/api/Rex/Commands.pm.html#parallelism-count-">documentation</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Set parallelism automatically (fix #491) - Ferenc Erki</li>

<h2>Bugfixes</h2>

<p>The following bugs/regressions were also fixed during this release cycle:</p>

<h3>Uploading files from Windows to Linux</h3>

<p>File upload from Windows machines was fixed
by checking the availability of <code>uname</code> and <code>md5sum</code> commands
before trying to use them.
This fix has been released as rex-1.2.1 as well.</p>

<ul>
<li>first detect if uname and md5sum can be run, then use it. fixed #665 - Jan</li>
</ul>

<h3>do_task + before_task_start with modules</h3>

<p>Fixed an issue when a task was specified in a module
<em>and</em> had a <code>before_task_start</code> hook attached to it,
then called with <code>do_task</code> from a different module.</p>

<ul>
<li>this commit fixes #667. this bug was introduced with the fix for #629 - Jan</li>
</ul>

<h3>General</h3>

<p>This release also has some general fixes,
most notably around <code>sudo</code> usage
(like avoiding an endless loop when used together with <code>auth for</code>
or suppressing warnings about missing locales).</p>

<ul>
<li>fixed the fix :-) the original fix was in the wrong subroutine - #692 - Jan</li>
<li>Don't run into an endless loop: fix for #692 - Jan Gehring</li>
<li>Fix auth test when REX_USER env is present - Dmitry Kopytov</li>
<li>this prevents the stderr output of perl to get send over the wire. fixes #658 - Jan</li>
<li>fix warning if local file is not given. fixed #647 - Jan</li>
</ul>
