title: Release notes for 1.12.0
---

This is a new minor release which adds support for local rsync operations, improves tab completion for Bash and Zsh, and fixes related bugs. It also discontinues support for running Rex on Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, and older versions since both mainstream and extended support has already ended for these products.

Please see the [changelog](https://metacpan.org/source/FERKI/Rex-1.12.0/ChangeLog) for full details. Upgrade is recommended for all users. 

Many thanks to [all contributors](https://metacpan.org/source/FERKI/Rex-1.12.0/CONTRIBUTORS) who made this release possible!
