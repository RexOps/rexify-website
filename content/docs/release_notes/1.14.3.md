title: Release notes for 1.14.3
date: 2023-08-05
---

This is a new patch release containing bug fixes.

- Fix local package installation

    Properly pass environment variables to underlying commands to prevent related warnings or errors.

- Fix checking command existence

    Support systems with command existence checks indicating success via their exit codes, while reporting an error. Rex now double-checks whether the reported command candidate actually exists in the file system or not.

- Fix tests related to Git functionality
    - Properly skip without `git` binary.
    - Ignore global and system configuration during tests.
    - Pass even with ancient `git` versions which does not support `-C` command line option (before Git 1.8.5).

Many thanks to [all contributors](https://metacpan.org/source/FERKI/Rex-1.14.3/CONTRIBUTORS) who made this release possible.
