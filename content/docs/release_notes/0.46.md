title: Release notes for 0.46
---

These are the changes in 0.46 release.

We want to thank all the people for contributing code and to fill bug reports. This helps making Rex better and better :)

## Incompatible Changes

We're sorry, but this release comes with some incompatible changes. The most changes won't effect the majority of users, but we needed to change those things to fix some nasty things and to be more flexible in the future.

-   Reporting: The report format changed. The output and the internal API of the reporting interface changed. With this change we are more flexible for future improvements.
-   User module: We changed the creation of home directories to follow the policy of the target system.
-   Core: Caching is now active by default. This might break things if you're using chroot() inside a task, to change to another system. (For example to chroot from a debian system into a redhat system.)

## Rex::Test

With Rex::Test it is possible to test your Rexfile on a local VM before executing the code on your servers. Rex::Test uses Rex::Box to create the VM, but currently it only supports VirtualBox VMs.

To create a test just create a new file inside a *t* directory: *t/base.t*.

    ```perl
    use Rex::Test::Base;
    use Data::Dumper;
    use Rex -base;
    
    test {
        my $t = shift;
    
        $t->name("ubuntu test");
    
        $t->base_vm("http://box.rexify.org/box/ubuntu-server-12.10-amd64.ova");
        $t->vm_auth( user => "root", password => "box" );
    
        $t->run_task("setup");
    
        $t->has_package("vim");
        $t->has_package("ntp");
        $t->has_package("unzip");
        $t->has_file("/etc/ntp.conf");
        $t->has_service_running("ntp");
        $t->has_content( "/etc/passwd", qr{root:x:0:}ms );
    
        run "ls -l";
        $t->ok( $? == 0, "ls -l returns success." );
    
        $t->finish;
    };
    
    1;
    ```

## Rex::Box

Create clean development environments for your projects. Test your software in a production like environment.

With Rex/Boxes you can easily create your test environment with VirtualBox. You can use prebuild VM Images or roll your own. Read the [quickstart guide](http://box.rexify.org/guide) to create your own environment in minutes.

-   This release brings support for KVM boxes. The KVM Rex::Box provider also allows the creation of Boxes on remote systems.

        ```perl
        # Rexfile
        set box => "KVM";
        
        #
        # CALL:
        # rex init --name=gpw --url=http://domain.tld/ubuntu-server-12.10-amd64.qcow2
        desc "Initialize and start the VM: rex init --name=vmname [--url=http://...]";
        task "init", make {
            my $param = shift;
        
            box {
                my ($box) = @_;
                $box->name( $param->{name} );
        
                # where to download the base image
                $box->url( $param->{url} );
        
                # default is nat
                $box->network(
                    1 => {
                        type => "nat",
                    },
                    2 => {
                        type   => "bridged",
                        bridge => "br1",
                    }
                );
        
                # define the authentication to the box
                # if you're downloading one from box.rexify.org this is the default.
                $box->auth(
                    user     => "root",
                    password => "box",
                );
        
                # if you want to provision the machine,
                # you can define the tasks to do that
                $box->setup(qw/install_webserver/);
            };
        
        };
        ```

## Cloud

Changes in the Cloud API

-   Support for RackSpace via [modules](#).

    -   Authentication and endpoint.

            ```perl
            cloud_service "RackSpace";
            cloud_auth "user", "key";
            cloud_region "IAD";
            ```

    -   Creating volumes and vms.

            ```perl
            cloud_service "RackSpace";
            my $vol_id = cloud_volume create => { size => 1, };
            
            my $instance = cloud_instance create => {
                image_id => "80fbcb55-b206-41f9-9bc2-2dd7aac6c061",
                name     => "myvm01",
                flavor   => "performance1-1",
                networks => ["a733f9d7-098e-4bf1-881d-5a91e84b44bb"]; # networks is optional
            };
            
            cloud_volume
              attach => $vol_id,
              to     => $instance->{id};
            ```

    -   Terminating an instance and removing the volume.

            ```perl
            cloud_service "RackSpace";
            cloud_instance terminate => $instance->{id};
            cloud_volume delete      => $vol_id;
            ```

-   fixed a case where amazon returns instance item in an array - Kasim Tuman
-   fixed multiple tags - David Golovan

## Reporting

-   Refactored report generation. This change break backward compatibility because the report format changed.

## Core

-   Caching is now enabled by default. This might break backward compatibility if you're using chroot() inside a task to chroot to another OS.

-   Allow passing template content to template command - \#345 - reneeb

        ```perl
        file "/etc/file.cnf",
          content => template( \'<%= $name %> is cool!', name => 'Rex' );
        ```

-   Added 'no\_cache' feature. If you need to disable the cache, use this.

        ```perl
        # Rexfile
        use Rex -feature => ['no_cache'];
        ```

-   Added a special load path for perl libraries, so that we don't mix up perl and rex modules. (lib/perl)

-   Refactored handling of home directory creation. This might break compat. because we are following the system default now. (added create\_home option) - \#270 - FErki

-   CMDB path can now have variables / can be extended.

        ```perl
        # Rexfile
        use Rex::CMDB;
        set cmdb => {
            type => "YAML",
            path => [
                "cmdb/{operatingsystem}/{hostname}.yml", "cmdb/{operatingsystem}/default.yml",
                "cmdb/{environment}/{hostname}.yml",     "cmdb/{environment}/default.yml",
                "cmdb/{hostname}.yml",                   "cmdb/default.yml",
            ],
        };
        ```

-   Connect failure reports "Error running task/batch: Wrong username/password or wrong key" - \#359 - eduardoj

-   Extended rexify command to work with git.

-   Added description to environments - \#274

        ```perl
        # Rexfile
        desc "The live environment";
        environment live => sub { };
        ```

-   Added `groups_dbi()` function to generate server groups from sql - \#346 - Jean-Marie RENOUARD

-   Added `groups_yaml()` function to generate server groups from yaml file - Jean-Marie RENOUARD

-   Add support for df on a given mount point - Simon Bertrang

-   Added authentication to download() function. - \#340

        ```perl
        download "http://secured.location.tld/foo.tgz", "foo.tgz",
          user     => "httpuser",
          password => "password";
        ```

-   Refactored tmp dir generation - FErki
