We would like to welcome Leah Neukirchen as new contributor, and many thanks to
all contributors who made this release possible!

## Release highlights

### Initial support to manage Void Linux systems

  * Added Rex::Pkg::VoidLinux using XBPS - Leah Neukirchen
  * Added Rex::Service::VoidLinux using runit - Leah Neukirchen
  * Added Void Linux - Leah Neukirchen

It is now possible to manage packages and services on Void Linux systems.

## New features

  * Make waitpid blocking sleep time configurable - Ferenc Erki

If really needed, it could be tuned using e.g.
`set waitpid_blocking_sleep_time => 0.001;` (time in seconds). Setting it to a
low value might help speed up cases when Rex is managing the local machine, and
higher values might help on high latency networks. Default is 0.1s.

  * Map commit authors to their canonical name and email - Ferenc Erki
  * Add contributors without commits on master branch - Ferenc Erki
  * Generate CONTRIBUTORS file - Ferenc Erki
  * Add Kwalitee tests - Ferenc Erki

## Enhancements

  * Match waitpid blocking sleep between fork managers - Ferenc Erki

## Bugfixes

  * Update Perl::Tidy on each Travis build - Ferenc Erki
  * Skip bin tidiness check on Windows and Mac - Ferenc Erki
