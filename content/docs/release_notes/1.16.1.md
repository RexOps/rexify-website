title: Release notes for 1.16.1

This is a new patch release containing bug fixes and documentation updates.

## Fix hostgroup membership list

Calling `connection->server->groups` now correctly returns all hostgroup names a host belongs to.

## Fix command existence checks without `which`

Some non-Windows systems do not have a `which` binary, others (like Red Hat derivatives) may define `which` as a shell function. The [`can_run()`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Rex::Commands::Run#can_run) command now uses `command -v` instead.

## Test with extra GitHub Actions runners

Our GitHub Actions workflow now runs the test suite on DragonflyBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Solaris. This allows us to catch issues sooner than before, and we already fixed the following:

- Fix FQDN parsing
- Handle SMBios errors gracefully
- Fix parsing free memory on Solaris
- Fix shared variable lockfile on Solaris
- Prefer GNU tools on Solaris
- Fix parsing FreeBSD memory details
- Recognize laundry memory on FreeBSD

Please see the [CPAN release page](https://metacpan.org/release/FERKI/Rex-1.16.1) for the changelog.

Many thanks to [all contributors](https://metacpan.org/source/FERKI/Rex-1.16.1/CONTRIBUTORS) who made this release possible.
