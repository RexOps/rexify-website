title: Release notes for 1.14.2
date: 2023-05-05
---

This is a new patch release containing bug fixes, along with some internal restructuring. Notably:

- using the `cwd` option of `run` now works when switching to a path on another drive while executing commands locally on Windows
- cloning a git repository into an existing empty directory via `checkout` now works the same as with the `git` binary

In preparation to the imminent release of perl-5.38.0, the test suite now also passes on perl-5.37.9 and later.

Please see the [CPAN release page](https://metacpan.org/release/FERKI/Rex-1.14.2) for the full changelog.

Many thanks to [all contributors](https://metacpan.org/source/FERKI/Rex-1.14.2/CONTRIBUTORS) who made this release possible.
