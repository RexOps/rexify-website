title: Release notes for 1.12.2
---

This is a new patch release which fixes various regressions around inventory, custom template functions and configuration file handling, as well as bugs around file hooks and checksumming. Upgrade is highly recommended for all users.

For packagers, I'd also like to highlight that Rex now fully describes both its OS-specific and optional dependencies. If in doubt, it's recommended to install all optional dependencies to provide a complete out-of-the-box experience for end users.

Please see the [CPAN release page](https://metacpan.org/release/FERKI/Rex-1.12.2) for the changelog.

Many thanks to [all contributors](https://metacpan.org/source/FERKI/Rex-1.12.2/CONTRIBUTORS) who made this release possible! We are delighted to welcome Peter Jankovics as new contributor!
