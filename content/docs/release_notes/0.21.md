## Rex

-   Source control

    Now you can checkout subversion and git repositories with Rex.

        ```perl
        set
          repository => "myrepo",
          url        => "git@foo.bar:myrepo.git";
        
        task "checkout", sub {
            checkout "myrepo";
        };
        ```

    See [Rex::Commands::SCM](https://metacpan.org/pod/Rex::Commands::SCM) for more information.

-   allow multiple groups for a task

        ```perl
        group "frontend" => "fe01", "fe02";
        group "backend"  => "be01", "be02";
        
        task "prepare",
          group => [ "frontend", "backend" ],
          sub {
            say run "uptime";
          };
        ```

-   every task can have its own auth information

        ```perl
        user "root";
        password "test";
        
        task "prepare", "server1", sub {
        
            # will authenticate as root/test
        };
        
        task "prepare2", "server1", sub {
        
            # will also authenticate as root/test
        };
        
        # all tasks from here down will authenticate as deploy/testdeploy
        user "deploy";
        password "testdeploy";
        task "deploy", "server1", sub {
        
            # will authenticate as deploy/testdeploy
        };
        ```

-   fixed running of multiple tasks by do\_task

-   user module: add ssh key

        ```perl
        task "createuser", "server1", sub {
            create_user "foo",
              home    => "/home/foo",
              ssh_key => "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAAB...";
        };
        ```

-   use generic auth method from Net::SSH2 (patch from Jose Luis Martinez)

-   ssh port isn't fix anymore (patch from Jose Luis Martinez)

        ```perl
        group "frontend", "fe01:2222", "fe02";
        ```

    Rex will now connect to fe01 on port 2222 and to fe02 on port 22.

        ```perl
        port 2222;
        task "prepare", "server1", "server2", sub {
        
            # will always connect to port 2222
        };
        ```

-   file and upload now scans for environment specific files first

        ```perl
        task "upload", "server1", sub {
            file "/etc/passwd", source => "files/etc/passwd";
        };
        ```

    If called with *rex -E stage* it will first try to upload "files/etc/passwd.stage" and if not found "files/etc/passwd"

-   fixed windows syslog bug \#6, thanks to aero

-   added -nolog parameter to logging function to disable logging at all

-   added possibility to evaluate perl code within the -H CLI parameter

        bash# rex -H 'perl:map { "server-$_"; } (1,2,3)' task
