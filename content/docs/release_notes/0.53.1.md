title: Release notes for 0.53.1
---

These are the changes in 0.53 release.

This release brings a few bugfixes and compatibility to the current [Rex::JobControl](https://github.com/RexOps/rex-jobcontrol) Webfrontend.

A first version of the Rex::JobControl Webfrontend will also be released in the next days. But this will be a separate anouncement.

## Base

-   Added a new **resource** function.

    A *resource* is a perl function that represent a *object* on your server. An *object* is for example a virtual host configuration for apache, a database user or a more complex thing like a Tomcat instance. With the resource() function it is possible to create custom resources that will also appear in the reporting.

    Resources have a special syntax and some keywords.

        ```perl
        resource $resource_name,
          option1 => "value1",
          option2 => "value2",
          ensure  => "present, absent, ...";
        ```

    Currently there is only one keyword that every resource have to obey.

    -   **ensure** - Can be *present* (default if not set) or *absent* or any other string.

    Every resource should also emit a changed signal if the resource did changes. With this signal the *on\_change* hook gets triggered and the reporting knows that the resource changed something.

    resource() parameters will also be visible in the templates without the need to register them.

    Resources get registerd as perl functions in the namespace where they are created. You can see a complete example [here](#).

        ```perl
        package BaseSystem;
        use Rex::Resource::Common;
        resource "motd", sub {
            my ($params) = @_;
            my $name = resource_name;
        
            if ( $params->{ensure} eq "present" ) {
        
                # do some things.
                if ( !is_file($name) ) {
                    file $name, content => $params->{content};
                    emit changed;
                }
            }
            elsif ( $params->{ensure} eq "absent" ) {
                if ( is_file($name) ) {
                    rm $name;
                    emit changed;
                }
            }
        };
        ```

    Now you can call this new resource with `BaseSystem::motd`

        ```perl
        use BaseSystem;
        task "setup", sub {
            BaseSystem::motd "/etc/motd",
              ensure    => present,
              content   => "Hello World.",
              on_change => sub {
        
                # do something when changed event was triggered
              };
        };
        ```

-   Added new feature flag **register\_cmdb\_top\_scope**. This will register all the topscope variables in your CMDB to templates.

## Bugfixes

-   fixed on\_change hook for file() resource when file was removed.
