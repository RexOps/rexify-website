title: Release notes for 0.17

## Rex

-   Added Solaris 11 support

-   Added Solaris 10 support

-   Added a caching layer

    There is a new command line switch *-c* to turn on caching. Right now only the Rex::Hardware::Host module uses this layer but this should already speed up execution on \*BSD and Solaris systems.

-   Added possibility to define custom providers for package and service management.

    For example with Solaris you can use Blastwave, OpenCSW or the standard utilities for package management.

    Copy to clipboard

         # in the base section of your Rexfile
         package_provider_for SunOS => "Blastwave";
         
         task "prepare", "server1", "server2", sub {
            # if solaris, install apache-22 from Blastwave
            install package => "apache-22";
         }; 

    Or, if you want to use OpenCSW

    Copy to clipboard

         # in the base section of your Rexfile
         package_provider_for SunOS => "OpenCSW";
         
         task "prepare", "server1", "server2", sub {
            # if solaris, install apache-22 from OpenCSW
            install package => "apache-22";
         }; 

    Or, for Solaris 11, use the built-in "pkg" Package Management:

    Copy to clipboard

         # in the base section of your Rexfile
         package_provider_for SunOS => "pkg";
         
         task "prepare", "server1", "server2", sub {
            # if solaris, install apache-22 from built-in pkg
            install package => "apache-22";
         }; 

-   Custom providers for service management

    For example with Solaris, if you want to use the old init-style service management you don't need to specify anything.

    Copy to clipboard

         task "prepare-services", "server1", "server2", sub {
            service ssh => "restart";
         };

    But, if you want to use the newer SVCADM management use this:

    Copy to clipboard

         # in the base section of your Rexfile
         service_provider_for SunOS => "svcadm";
         
         task "prepare-services", "server1", "server2", sub {
            service ssh => "restart";
         };

-   Added *operating\_system\_version()* to get the OS version.

    Copy to clipboard

         task "prepare", "server1", "server2", sub {
            if(operating_system_version() < 10) {
               say "too old...";
            }
         };

-   fixed local copy error handling
