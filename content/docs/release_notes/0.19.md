## Rex

-   Added output modules. First output module is a JUnit compatible output to use Rex together with Jenkins.

    Copy to clipboard

         rex -o JUnit $task

    This will product a file junit\_output.xml which can be used by Jenkins.

-   Added support for environments.

    With environments one can use the same task for different hosts and/or with different credentials. For example if you want to use the same task on your integration, test and production servers.

         # define default user/password
         user "root";
         password "foobar";
         pass_auth;
             
         # define default frontend group containing only testwww01
         group frontend => "testwww01";
             
         # define live environment, with different user/password 
         # and a frontend server group containing www01, www02 and www03
         environment live => sub {
            user "root";
            password "livefoo";
            pass_auth;
               
            group frontend => "www01", "www02", "www03";
         };
             
         # define stage environment with default user and password, but with 
         # an own frontend group containing only stagewww01
         environment stage => sub {
            group frontend => "stagewww01";
         };
            
         task "prepare", group => "frontend", sub {
             say run "hostname";
         };

    -   Calling *rex prepare* will execute on testwww01 with root/foobar credentials
    -   Calling *rex -E live prepare* will execute on www01, www02, www03 with root/livefoo credentials
    -   Calling *rex -E stage prepare* will execute on stagewww01 with root/foobar credentials

-   Load Rex::Commands:Process as default now.
