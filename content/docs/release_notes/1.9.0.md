title: Release notes for 1.9.0
---

This is a new minor release, adding a new feature flag to force writing UTF-8
encoded files, documenting configuration options, and fixing bugs. Upgrade is
recommended for all users.

Many thanks to all contributors who made this release possible!

# Changes

## New features
  - Add `write_utf8_files` feature flag to control encoding of files written
    by Rex

    It is intended to complement the `utf8` pragma in Rexfiles and modules:

        ```perl
        use utf8;
        use Rex -feature => ['write_utf8_files'];
        ```

## Bug fixes
  - Fix setting custom `waitpid_blocking_sleep_time`
  - Fix `autodie` feature for local `unlink` commands

## Documentation
  - Categorize file system commands based on ability to change contents
  - Clarify documentation of file system commands
  - [Document configuration methods](https://metacpan.org/pod/Rex::Config)
