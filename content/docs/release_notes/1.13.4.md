title: Release notes for 1.13.4
date: 2021-07-05

This is a new patch release containing documentation updates, and a fix for inconsistent behavior between the `content` and `source` options of the file command.

Previously only the `content` option had the following:

- execute `before_change` and `after_change` hooks
- use a temporary file before moving the new file to its final target

Now the `source` option behaves consistently with `content`, and does all the above.

Please see the [CPAN release page](https://metacpan.org/release/FERKI/Rex-1.13.4) for the changelog.

Many thanks to [all contributors](https://metacpan.org/source/FERKI/Rex-1.13.4/CONTRIBUTORS) who made this release possible. We are delighted to welcome Gabor Szabo as new contributor!
