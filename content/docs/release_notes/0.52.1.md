title: Release notes for 0.52.1
---

These are the changes in 0.52 release.

This release don't bring many new features but fixes bugs and enhanced some existing functions.

But we have another delicacy for you. Currently we are developing an easy to use **Webfrontend** for Rex. A first working development snapshot is available at <https://github.com/RexOps/rex-jobcontrol>. You will also find some screenshots there.

The installation is easy and it is described in the README.md file in the repository.

We welcome any feedback and if you want to help developing this webfrontend feel free to contact us via irc on [irc.freenode.net](irc://irc.freenode.net/#rex) \#rex.

## Base

-   **on\_change** hook for update\_system

        ```perl
        update_system on_change => sub {
            my (@modified_packates) = @_;
            for my $pkg (@modified_packages) {
                say "Name: $pkg->{name}";
                say "Version: $pkg->{version}";
                say "Action: $pkg->{action}"; # some of updated, installed or removed
            }
        };
        ```

-   Added support for **end\_if\_matched** option to run command - nathanIL

        ```perl
        run "my_command", end_if_matched => qr/PATTERN/;
        ```

-   Tie server.ini to specified -E environment (server.$environment.ini). - ehu

-   Added **before\_task\_start** and **after\_task\_finished** hooks

    The before\_task\_start hook will be executed before the fork for the task is made. The after\_task\_finished hook will be executed after all servers has finished the task.

        ```perl
        before_task_start mytask => sub {
        
            # do some things
        };
        after_task_finished mytask => sub {
        
            # do some things
        };
        ```

-   Added **fallback authentication** support.

    Sometimes you have different authentications on different hosts and you don't know beforehand which one you have to use. For these cases you can now define multiple authentication options. Rex will try all of them.

        ```perl
        auth
          fallback => {
            user        => "fallback_user1",
            password    => "fallback_pw1",
            public_key  => "",
            private_key => "",
          },
          {
            user        => "fallback_user2",
            password    => "fallback_pw2",
            public_key  => "keys/public.key",
            private_key => "keys/private.key",
            sudo        => TRUE,
          };
        ```
