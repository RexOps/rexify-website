# General

-   Speed improvement

    The *-c* (cache) CLI option speeds up execution very much.

-   Profiler class

    This is mostly for developers. There is now a profiler class to profile execution of *things*.

    If you want to generate a profiling output you can do this with:

        rex -dd $yourtask

-   Mounting (thanks to Laird Liu)

    It is now possible to write mount entries to /etc/fstab with the *persistent* option.

        ```perl
        mount "/dev/sda5", "/mnt/sda5", persistent => TRUE;
        ```

-   Partitioning

    It is now possible to mount the new created partition.

        ```perl
        partition "/",
          fstype => "ext3",
          size   => 15000,
          ondisk => "sda",
          type   => "primary",
          mount  => TRUE;
        ```

    And if you want to write fstab entries directly.

        ```perl
        partition "/",
          fstype           => "ext3",
          size             => 15000,
          ondisk           => "sda",
          type             => "primary",
          mount_persistent => TRUE;
        ```

-   New keyword *make*.

    This is just a cosmetic one. It is now possible to write tasks this way:

        ```perl
        # old
        task prepare => sub {

          # do something
        };

        # new
        task prepare => make {

          # do something
        };

        # old
        task "prepare",
          group => "foo",
          sub {
          # do something
          };

        # new
        task "prepare",
          group => "foo",
          make {
          # do something
          };
        ```

-   Usability improvements, thanks to Anders Ossowicki

# User Management

-   New option *no\_create\_home*

    There is a new option *no\_create\_home*. If this option is set the home directory of the user will not be created.

    If the *ssh\_key* option is set it will only create the .ssh directory if the home directory exists.

        ```perl
        create_user "foo",
          home           => "/data/homes/foo",
          no_create_home => TRUE;
        ```

-   Fixed *expire* bug for create\_user

# Templates

-   Template class now exchangeable (thanks to Laird Liu)

    If you want to use another Template class (for example Template::Toolkit) you can use it now.

        ```perl
        # Rexfile
        use strict;
        use warnings;

        use Template;

        set template_function => sub {
          my ( $content, $vars ) = @_;
          my $t = Template->new;
          my $out;
          $t->process( \$content, $vars, \$out );
          return $out;
        };

        task foo => sub {
          file "/etc/foo/service.conf",
            content => template(
            "service.conf.tpl",
            name => "foo",
            port => 1903
            );
        };
        ```

# Modules

It is now easier to write independent modules. There is no break in compatibility. Both ways will work. But we suggest to rewrite/move your files.

Old-way module structure:

-   lib/Apache.pm

-   lib/templates/apache-template

-   lib/Apache/SubModule.pm

New module structure:

-   lib/Apache/Module.pm (this is the old lib/Apache.pm)

-   lib/Apache/templates/apache-template

-   lib/Apache/SubModule.pm

## Converting an old module

It is easy to convert an old module. For the example from above, you just have to move the file "lib/Apache.pm" to "lib/Apache/Module.pm" (no code changes needed). And move the templates to "lib/Apache/templates".
