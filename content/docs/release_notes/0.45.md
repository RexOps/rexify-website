## Cloud

Changes in the Cloud API

-   OpenStack Support - Ferenc Erki

    -   Authentication and endpoint.

            ```perl
            cloud_service "OpenStack";
            cloud_auth
              tenant_name => "tenant",
              username    => "user",
              password    => "password";
            cloud_region "http://openstack.domain.tld:5000/v2.0";
            ```

    -   Creating volumes and vms.

            ```perl
            my $vol_id = cloud_volume create => { size => 1, zone => "nova", };

            my $instance = cloud_instance create => {
              image_id => "ccd8bcab-8ad2-4744-8227-08279fab7a42",
              name     => "ostack01",
              plan_id  => 2,
              volume   => $vol_id,
            };
            ```

    -   Terminating an instance and removing the volume.

            ```perl
            cloud_instance terminate => $instance->{id};
            cloud_volume delete      => $vol_id;
            ```

-   added cloud\_image\_list() function
-   added cloud\_network() function to manage cloud networks if the provider supports it

## Common

Changes in the core. These include new resources and new options for existing one.

-   new options for the file() resource

    -   no\_overwrite option for file() resource.

        If this option is set, the file will never be overwritten.

            ```perl
            file "/var/named/$zone->{name}.zone",
              content => template( '@zone-file.tpl', conf => $conf, %{$zone} ),
              owner   => "named",
              group   => "named",
              no_overwrite => TRUE;
            ```

    -   ensure directory option for file().

        If the ensure option is set to directory the file() resource will create a directory instead of a file

            ```perl
            file "/var/named",
              ensure => "directory",
              owner  => "named",
              group  => "named";
            ```

    -   allow array for file() resource.

        This allow operations on multiple files without duplicating the code.

            ```perl
            file [
              "/etc/rex/io/inventory/bootdevice",
              "/etc/rex/io/inventory/bridge",
              "/etc/rex/io/inventory/sysinfo",
              "/etc/rex/io/inventory/os"
              ],
              owner => "root",
              group => "root",
              mode  => 755;
            ```

-   New options for run() resource.

    -   run() resource can now have a name.

        This is needed for notifications, if a command should only be executed if notified.

            ```perl
            run "kill-process-httpd",
              command       => "killall -KILL httpd",
              only_notified => TRUE;

            # somewhere else in the code
            notify run => "kill-process-httpd";
            ```

    -   *creates* option for run() resource.

        This tell Rex that this command creates a special file. If this file is found, the command won't get executed anymore.

            ```perl
            run "download-ipxe",
              command =>
              "wget -O /var/lib/tftpboot/undionly.ipxe http://boot.ipxe.org/undionly.kpxe",
              creates => "/var/lib/tftpboot/undionly.ipxe";
            ```

    -   *only\_if* and *unless* option for run() resource.

        This will execute the command only if the command given will execute successfully (or terminate unsuccessfull).

            ```perl
            run "add-service-os",
              command => "mysql -uroot < /tmp/data.sql",
              unless =>
              "mysql -uroot dbschema -e 'SELECT id FROM os_template WHERE id=2' | grep -q 2";
            ```

    -   support for customized environments. - \#316 - andrejzverev

        It is now possible to add custom environment variables to the run() resource.

            ```perl
            run "my_command",
              env => {
              env_var_1 => "the value for 1",
              env_var_2 => "the value for 2",
              };
            ```

-   Added notifications for *run* and *service*.

    -   services will notified at the end of the task.

            ```perl
            service "httpd", ensure => "running";

            # somewhere else in the code
            file "/etc/httpd/httpd.conf",
              content   => template( "templates/httpd.conf.tpl", %vars ),
              on_change => sub { notify service => "httpd"; };
            ```

-   *pkg* resource (replacement for install function).

        ```perl
        pkg "vim",      ensure => "present";
        pkg "httpd",    ensure => "2.4.6";
        pkg "vim-tiny", ensure => "absent";
        pkg [ "tftp-server", "wget" ], ensure => "latest";
        ```

-   Added account() resource (as replacement for create\_user).

        ```perl
        account "krimdomu",
          ensure         => "present",
          uid            => 509,
          home           => '/root',
          comment        => 'User Account',
          expire         => '2011-05-30',
          groups         => [ 'root', '...' ],
          password       => 'blahblah',
          system         => 1,
          no_create_home => TRUE,
          ssh_key        => "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQChUw...";
        ```

-   Support -g to supply group name - \#330 - fanyeren

-   *can\_run()* now returns the first command found as string - \#193

-   read cpu information out of /proc/cpuinfo if dmidecode is not available - \#306
