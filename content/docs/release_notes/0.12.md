## Rex

-   Added *sudo* command

        sudo_password "mypassword";

        task "dosomething", sub {
          say sudo "id";
        };

-   Allow to manage multiple services at once.

        task "start", sub {
          service [qw/apache2 rsyslog ftp/] => "start";
        };

-   Added possibility to add and remove services from runlevels

        use Rex::Commands::Iptables;
        task "prepare", sub {
          service apache2 => "ensure", "started";
          service apache2 => "ensure", "stopped";
        };

-   Added an iptables module to manage basic iptables rules.

        task "firewall", sub {

          # clear all rules
          iptables_clear;

          # open port 22 on all devices
          open_port 22;

          # open port 22 and 80 on eth0
          open_port [ 22, 80 ] => { dev => "eth0", };

          # close all ports on all devices
          close_port "all";

          # close port 22 on dev eth0
          close_port 22 => { dev => "eth0", };

          # redirect port 80 to 10080
          redirect_port 80 => 10080;

          # redirect port 80 to 10080 on eth0
          redirect_port 80 => {
            dev => "eth0",
            to  => 10080,
          };

        # set default state rules (RELATED,ESTABLISHED) to accept on all devices
          default_state_rule;

          # set default state rules (RELATED,ESTABLISHED) to accept on eth0
          default_state_rule dev => "eth0";

          # make the system a nat gateway for its default route
          # this will set the sysctl entry net.ipv4.ip_forward to 1, too.
          is_nat_gateway;

          # define a custom iptables rule
          iptables t => "filter", A => "INPUT", i => "eth0", ...;
        };

-   Added Amazon EC2 Support

        use Data::Dumper;
        use Rex::Commands::Cloud;

        user "root";
        public_key "/path/to/your/ec2-public.key";
        private_key "/path/to/your/ec2-private.key.pem";

        # set the cloud service provider to "Amazon"
        cloud_service "Amazon";

        # set cloud auth
        cloud_auth "$access_key", "$secret_access_key";

        # set cloud region
        cloud_region "ec2.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com";

        # define a group with all running ec2 instances
        group ec2 => get_cloud_instances_as_group();

        task "list", sub {
          print Dumper cloud_instances_list;
          print Dumper cloud_volume_list;

          print Dumper get_cloud_regions;
          print Dumper get_cloud_availability_zones;
        };

        task "create", sub {

          # if you want an ebs volume, create it. if not, you don't need this.
          my $vol_id =
            cloud_volume create => { size => 1, zone => "eu-west-1a"; };

          # create the cloud instances and attach the just created ebs volume.
          cloud_instance create => {
            image_id => "ami-02103876",
            name     => "test-ec2",
            key      => "my-test-key",
            volume   => $vol_id,       # if you don't have a volume, skip this
            zone => "eu-west-1a", # the volume and the instance must be in the same zone. skip this if you don't have a volume.
          };
        };

        task "destroy", sub {
          cloud_volume detach      => "vol-xxaabb";
          cloud_instance terminate => "i-ffgghhjj";
          cloud_colume delete      => "vol-xxaabb";
        };

        task "prepare",
          group => "ec2",
          sub {
          run "apt-get update";
          install package => "apache2";
          service apache2 => "start";
          };
