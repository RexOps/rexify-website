## Rex

-   License changed to GPL3

-   Rex is now running under Windows. Tested with ActiveState Perl 5.12 and Windows 7. See the [Get Rex](/get) page for installation instructions.

-   Added support for JiffyBox, a German cloud service of [domainfactory](http://www.df.eu).

        use Rex::Commands::Cloud;

        user "root";
        password "f00b4r";
        pass_auth;

        cloud_service "Jiffybox";
        cloud_auth "yourkey";

        group jiffybox => get_cloud_instances_as_group();

        task "create", sub {
          cloud_instance create => {
            image_id => "debian_squeeze_64bit",
            name     => "test01",
            plan_id  => 10,
            password => "f00b4r",
          };
        };

        task "prepare",
          group => "jiffybox",
          sub {
          update_package_db;
          install package => "apache2";
          };

        $> rex create preare

-   Added function to update package database.

        task "update", "server1", "server2", sub {
          update_package_db;
        };

-   Revised error handling. Now every function throws an exception on failure.

        task "test", "server1", "server2", sub {
          unlink "/tmp/doesntexists"; # this will terminate the whole execution because it will fail.

          # this will catch the exception and store it in $@
          eval {
            unlink "/tmp/doesntexists";

            # and more stuff
          } or do {
            say "Tried to unlink /tmp/doesntexists but it failed.";
            say "Error: $@";
          };
        };

-   added *rm* as an alias function for unlink

-   Added cache for the sftp object. This should speed up the execution.
