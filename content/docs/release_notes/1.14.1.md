This is a new patch release containing bug fixes and documentation updates, along with some internal restructuring.

Notably, Rex now explicitly declares its dependencies for colored output, and some corner cases of recursive directory creation with `mkdir()` does not result in warnings anymore.

Please see the [CPAN release page](https://metacpan.org/release/FERKI/Rex-1.14.1) for the full changelog.

Many thanks to [all contributors](https://metacpan.org/source/FERKI/Rex-1.14.1/CONTRIBUTORS) who made this release possible.
