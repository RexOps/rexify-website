title: Release notes for 1.16.0
date: 2025-02-05
---

This is a new minor release containing new features and bug fixes.

## Improved command execution on Windows

- Quote command arguments: quoting of command arguments like `run 'perl', [
  '-e', 'print 1' ];` works on Windows now
- Support command environment variables: the `run()` command on Windows now
  supports passing environment variables to it via `env => { VAR => $value }`

## Require minimum perl-5.14.4

Rex now requires at least perl-5.14.4 to install. A transition towards newer
Perl versions enables us to start using modern Perl features throughout the
codebase.

## Fix git branch operations

- Detect default branch of git origin: automatically detect different default
  branch names based on git default configuration (for example `main` on Mac OS
  X)
- Fix git branch checkout operations: `checkout $repo, branch => $branch` did
  not switch to the target branch in the cloned repo when originally cloned
  with another branch
