These are the changes in 0.50 release.

## Base

-   **Added Proxy Command support**

    If you need to use a jump-host to connect to your servers, you can now use a proxy command to do so. This feature is only available if you're using the **OpenSSH** connection model.

        ```perl
        use Rex -feature => ['0.50'];
        set connection   => "OpenSSH";
        proxy_command "ssh user@jumphost nc %h %p 2>/dev/null";
        ```

-   **Added a new experimental execution model**

    In the default mode the parallelity is managed by Rex::Fork::Manager which has limited capabilities regarding inter process communication and more things. See [this ticket](https://github.com/RexOps/Rex/issues/295) for more information.

    So with this release it is now possible to switch to [Parallel::ForkManager](https://metacpan.org/pod/Parallel::ForkManager) to handle the parallelism.

        ```perl
        use Rex -feature => ['0.50'];
        set_distributor "Parallel_ForkManager";
        ```

-   activate exit\_status feature by default for non parallel task execution

## Base

-   Use stat() output for directory and file tests (fix \#391) - FErki
-   fixed Problem with failed conditionals in Rex::Command::Run - \#389
