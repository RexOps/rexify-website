<p>We are proud to announce the 1.0.0 release of Rex. We want to thank every contributor that made this first major release possible. Rex 1.0 will be a <strong>LTS</strong> release, which means that it will get support from the community (at least) until <strong>march 2017</strong>.</p>

<p>We're developing Rex for more than 4 years and because Rex is now used in many production environments we felt it was the right time to release the first major version. We try to follow the <a href="http://www.semver.org/">semver</a> versioning scheme, so that it is possible to have a good deprecation path if things change.</p>

<p>Rex is a project completely driven by volunteers and without all the support from the community by using it, sending bug reports and feature requests and submitting patches it wouldn't be the great project it is. So many thanks to all of you. If you want to help developing Rex and become part of the core team, feel free to contact us on irc (irc.freenode.net / #rex).</p>

<p>These are the changes in 1.0.0 release.</p>

<h2>Common</h2>

<p>With Rex 1.0 we changed the communication from libssh2 (Net::SSH2) to openssh (Net::OpenSSH) by default, because many of us already uses this and it was also the default if featureset 0.55 was enabled. </p>

<ul>
<li>use Net::OpenSSH is now default. don't need feature flag 0.55 - Jan</li>
</ul>

<p>But you can always use the old communication with the following command:</p>

<pre><code class="perl">set connection => 'SSH';</code></pre>

<h4>augeas</h4>

<p>With augeas it is possible to edit configuration files without the need to use templates and to overwrite all of the file. So if you want to allow people to edit the configuration files on your servers also by hand (for example on test machines for your developers) you can use augeas to ensure that some specific parameters in these configuration files are set.</p>

<p>To use this it is required to have <em>augtool</em> installed on your servers. This is usually in the package <em>augeas</em> or <em>augeas-tools</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>migrated augeas module into Rex core - #532 - Jan</li>
<li>Optimise Rex::Commands::Augeas - Andrew Beverley</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="perl">use Rex::Commands::Augeas;

task "prepare", sub {
  augeas insert => "/files/etc/hosts",
    label     => "01",
    after     => "/7",
    ipaddr    => "192.168.2.23",
    canonical => "frontend01";

  augeas modify => 
    "/files/etc/ssh/sshd_config/PermitRootLogin" => "without-password",
    on_change => sub {
      service sshd => "restart";
    };
};
</code></pre>

<h4>PkgConf</h4>

<p>The PkgConf commands are especially usefull on debian/ubuntu systems to query and to modify package configurations. For example if you want to configure the mysql root password during package installation. To see more example please refer to the <a href="/api/Rex/Commands/PkgConf.pm.html">API</a> documentation.</p>

<ul>
<li>Add PkgConf command to configure packages - Andrew Beverley</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="perl">use Rex::Commands::PkgConf;

task "prepare", sub {
  set_pkgconf("mysql-server-5.5", [
    { question => 'mysql-server/root_password',       type => 'string', value => 'mysecret' },
    { question => 'mysql-server/root_password_again', type => 'string', value => 'mysecret' },
  ]);
};
</code></pre>

<h4>tty usage</h4>

<p>If you're using <code class="perl">use Rex -feature => ['1.0'];</code> tty usage is disabled. This increases the compatibility with some init scripts that don't <em>disown</em> from the running tty. If you're using <em>sudo</em> then you need to configure the user to not need a tty to run sudo.</p>

<pre><code>Defaults:username !requiretty</code></pre>

<p>If you can't change this behaviour you can always use the <em>tty</em> feature to tell Rex to spawn a tty.</p>

<pre><code>use Rex -feature => ['1.0', 'tty'];</code></pre>
