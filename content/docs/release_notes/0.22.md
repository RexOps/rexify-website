## Rex

-   Before and after hooks

          ```perl
          task
            prepare => "server1",
            "server2", sub {
          
            # do something
            };
          
          before prepare => sub {
            my ($server) = @_;
            say "Starting virtual machine...";
            run "xm start $server";
          };
          
          after prepare => sub {
            my ( $server, $failed_connection ) = @_;
            say "Stopping virtual machine...";
            run "xm stop $server";
          };
          ```

-   Systemd service provider for RedHat and SuSE.

-   Added [FusionInventory](http://fusioninventory.org/) support. If the agent is installed on the target maschine rex will use it for inventory.

-   It's now possible to set crypted passwords.

          ```perl
          task prepare_user => sub {
          
            create_user "foo" => {
              home           => '/home/foo',
              groups         => [ 'users', '...' ],
              crypt_password => '$1$.yBAfj8a$mQ2SY/lfz8FaSUTgHsP37c/',
              ssh_key        => "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQChUw...",
            };
          
          };
          ```

-   Bugs were fixed.
