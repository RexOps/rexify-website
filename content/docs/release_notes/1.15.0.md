title: Release notes for 1.15.0
date: 2024-11-05

This is a new minor release containing new features and bug fixes.

## Improved Augeas support

While making Rex::Commands::Augeas code testable, Rex gained new configuration options:

- Add config option to prepend Augeas commands
- Add config option to control local Augeas backend

The newly introduced tests helped expose hidden bugs, and we fixed:

- Inconsisent augtool wrapper usage
- Config::Augeas detection

## Fix detecting system package changes on Red Hat and similar

Red Hat and similar systems may have multiple different variations of a package with the same name installed at the same time, for example `kernel`.

Rex now takes enough package metadata into account to report proper list of package changes before and after package management operations.

This also fixes triggering related `on_change` callbacks of the `pkg` command on those systems.

## Other bugfixes

- Fix memory detection warnings on Solaris
- Fix missing argument warnings from Text::Wrap
- Fix precedence warning after perl-5.41.4
- Fix invalid default error in Parallel::ForkManager
- `can_run` returns only the first command when multiple candidates found in `PATH`

## Dependency changes

- Ignore faulty IO::Pty-1.18 on Mac OS X
- Require DBD::mysql as an optional test dependency
- Mark Parallel::ForkManager as a recommended optional dependency
- Mark Config::Augeas as a suggested optional dependency
- Remove IO::String as an unused dependency
