-   License was changed to Apache 2.0 License. See LICENSE file.

-   Added sudo compatibility. Now it is possible to use rex within a sudo environment.

         user "unprivuser";
         sudo_password "f00b4r";
         sudo -on;   # turn sudo globally on
         
         task prepare => sub {
            install "apache2";
            file "/etc/ntp.conf",
               source => "files/etc/ntp.conf",
               owner  => "root",
               mode   => 640;
         };
         

    Or, if you don't want to turn sudo globally on.

         task prepare => sub {
            file "/tmp/foo.txt",
               content => "this file was written without sudo privileges\n";
            
            # everything in this section will be executed with sudo privileges
            sudo sub {
               install "apache2";
               file "/tmp/foo2.txt",
                  content => "this file was written with sudo privileges\n";
            };
         };

-   Added a new function *include* to include Rex recipes without registering the tasks.

         include qw/Webserver::Apache Database::MySQL/;
         
         task prepare => sub {
            Webserver::Apache::setup();
         };

-   Added a sed-like function.

         task foo => sub {
            sed qr{search}, "replace", "/path/to/file";
         };

-   Package installation now possible with *install $pkg*.

         task prepare => sub {
            install "foo";
            # old way
            install package => "foo";
         };

-   Added *chdir* parameter to *extract* function.

            extract "/tmp/myfile.tar.gz",
              chdir => "/etc";
         };

-   *sync* exclude option now accepts a string or an array of strings. Thanks to Hiroaki Nakamura.

-   Added support for custom init commands.
