## Rex

-   License was changed to Apache 2.0 License. See LICENSE file.

-   Added sudo compatibility. Now it is possible to use rex within a sudo environment.

        ```perl
        user "unprivuser";
        sudo_password "f00b4r";
        sudo -on; # turn sudo globally on
        
        task prepare => sub {
            install "apache2";
            file "/etc/ntp.conf",
              source => "files/etc/ntp.conf",
              owner  => "root",
              mode   => 640;
        };
        ```

    Or, if you don't want to turn sudo globally on.

        ```perl
        task prepare => sub {
            file "/tmp/foo.txt",
              content => "this file was written without sudo privileges\n";
        
            # everything in this section will be executed with sudo privileges
            sudo sub {
                install "apache2";
                file "/tmp/foo2.txt", content => "this file was written with sudo privileges\n";
            };
        };
        ```

-   Added a new function *include* to include Rex recipes without registering the tasks.

        ```perl
        include qw/Webserver::Apache Database::MySQL/;
        
        task prepare => sub {
            Webserver::Apache::setup();
        };
        ```

-   Added a sed-like function.

        ```perl
        task foo => sub {
            sed qr{search}, "replace", "/path/to/file";
        };
        ```

-   Package installation now possible with *install $pkg*.

        ```perl
        task prepare => sub {
            install "foo";
        
            # old way
            install package => "foo";
        };
        ```

-   Added *chdir* parameter to *extract* function.

        ```perl
        task prepare => sub {
            extract "/tmp/myfile.tar.gz", chdir => "/etc";
        };
        ```

-   *sync* exclude option now accepts a string or an array of strings. Thanks to Hiroaki Nakamura.

-   Added support for custom init commands.

        ```perl
        task graceful_apache => sub {
            service httpd => "graceful";
        };
        ```
