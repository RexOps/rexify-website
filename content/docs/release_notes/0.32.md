# General

-   Reporting class

    There is now a new function called *report($string)*. This function will be used in future releases to send reporting strings to report servers.

-   Exchangeable worker module

    It is now possible to replace the default worker module with custom ones. One custom worker is [distributed-rex](https://github.com/krimdomu/distributed-rex), which distributes the execution of tasks with the help of [Gearman](http://gearman.org).

-   Amazon cloud module

    Fixed a bug with the *stop* command. And added *start* command.

-   ALT Linux support

    Many thanks to Nikolay Fetisov. He wrote the ALT linux module.
