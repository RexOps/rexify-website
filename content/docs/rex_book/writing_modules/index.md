* [Getting information of the environment](/docs/rex_book/writing_modules/getting_information_of_the_environment.html)  
  Often you need to know some things of the environment where you are
  currently connected. For example if you need to install apache on Debian
  and CentOS you have to provide different packages names.
* [Writing custom resources](/docs/rex_book/writing_modules/writing_custom_resources.html)  
  Resoures are the units that are responsible to manage your configurations.
