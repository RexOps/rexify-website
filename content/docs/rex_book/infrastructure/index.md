* [SSH as an agent](/docs/rex_book/infrastructure/ssh_as_an_agent.html)  
  To setup an environment to work with Rex you don't have to do much. You have to install Rex on your workstation or a central administration server. For most distributions you'll find packages on the package server.

* [Version Control with Git](/docs/rex_book/infrastructure/version_control_with_git.html)  
  We recommend you to use a version control system for your development. Especially if you're working in a team it will bring you many advantages.
