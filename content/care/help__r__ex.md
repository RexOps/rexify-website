title: Contribute to (R)?ex
---

There is no company behind (R)?ex. Everything is developed by volunteers around the globe during their free time. (R)?ex is a free, open source project. Every contribution is welcome.

## Get in contact

You'll find us on irc.freenode.net in the \#rex channel. Just be a bit patient, it might take a few minutes until someone answers.

## Documentation

The success of every project is its documentation. If there is no documentation a project won't be successful. So one part where you can help is writing user friendly documentation.
It is often hard to find a good balance between documenting new features (or removing deprecated documentation) and writing new code. So if you find outdated documentation, want to add guides, tweak the design or rewrite the complete webpage, don't hesitate to contact us.
You can clone the website code from GitHub. Please read the README file on how to get the website up and running on your local machine.
Please note that the API documentation is automatically generated for the website from the embedded pod sections of the files in the (R)?ex repo.

## Code

If you want to contribute new functionality or fix things, you can just clone the repository on GitHub and send pull requests against the development branch. We encourage you to logically group your commits together in topic/feature branches and send a pull request for each of them. We also appreciate nicely formatted and meaningful commit messages, for example something like described here.
We use perltidy to help us to maintain a consequent code style throughout the project (check out our .perltidyrc for more details). We recommend setting it up with your favorite IDE or text editor, so you can apply formatting easily or even automatically to your changes before committing them.
If you have any questions about how to implement something, join us on irc.freenode.net / \#rex.

## Sponsoring

As mentioned above (R)?ex is completely developed by volunteers. Which means there is no guarantee that a specific feature will be released at a defined date. If you need a special feature you can sponsor it, so we can focus our efforts on that feature. In this case contact us at feature@rexify.org.
Those sponsored features will also be released under the same license as (R)?ex itself. So it is guaranteed that it will remain  compatible with following releases and you will also have the benefit of a community finding potential bugs or contributing enhancements.

## Hardware

One special case is hardware. There can't be enough hardware/environments where we can test (R)?ex. Especially given our plans about Rex.IO and rex-jobcontrol - a bare metal deployer and webfrontend for (R)?ex. If you can donate any kind of hardware please contact us at sponsor@rexify.org.

### Our hardware sponsors:

We want to give a special thanks to the listed companies.
