[StackShare](https://stackshare.io) helps to "connect every developer in the world with the right tools and the companies using them", and Rex became one of those tools today.

This means it is not just easier to find as an available solution to IT automation challenges, but also easier for you to find organizations already using it.

If you use Rex, please consider adding it as part of your stack on StackShare!
