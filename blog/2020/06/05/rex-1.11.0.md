The [Rex-1.11.0 release](/docs/release_notes/1.11.0.html) is now [available on CPAN](https://metacpan.org/release/FERKI/Rex-1.11.0). It enhances the behaviour of sysctl and file management, fixes bugs about group management and OpenSSH connection options, and clarifies quite a bit of documentation.
